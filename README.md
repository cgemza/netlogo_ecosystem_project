# Advanced Ecosystem Simulation – NetLogo (Lab 10)

This project models an **advanced ecosystem** using NetLogo, focusing on interactions between agents such as predators, prey, and their environment. It was developed as part of a lab assignment for an introductory course in agent-based computer modeling.

## 🧪 Lab Objective

To explore emergent behaviors in complex systems through simulation of ecological interactions such as:

- Predator-prey dynamics
- Resource regeneration and consumption
- Population equilibrium and collapse
- Environmental constraints

## 🔧 How to Use

### Requirements
- [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) 6.3.0 or later

### Steps
1. Download the file `Lab10_advecosystem.netlogo.nlogo`.
2. Open it in the NetLogo application.
3. Click `Setup` to initialize the simulation.
4. Click `Go` to run the model.
5. Use sliders, switches, and monitors (if included) to interact with or observe model behavior.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Agent Types**: Predators, prey, and resources.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Change birth rates, death rates, movement speed, etc.
- **Visual Output**: Patches and turtles show real-time behavior in the view.
- **Graphing**: Real-time plots may track populations and resource levels.

## 📊 Possible Experiments

Try running scenarios with:
- Increased predator reproduction
- Limited food regeneration
- Habitat fragmentation or shrinking world size

Observe how stability is affected or if one species goes extinct.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand emergent behavior from simple rules
- Apply agent-based thinking to ecological problems
- Experiment with simulation to test hypotheses
